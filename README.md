### C++ Header Only Perlin Noise Generator

This project ports the Perlin Noise related code from Christian Petry's
"Texture Generator Online"'s Javascript implementation. Which of itself was a
port of Stefan Gustavson's Java implementation.

![example output](docs/example.gif)

Please note that "main.cpp" is an example program and uses SFML and FFMPEG,
however the noise class doesn't have a dependency on any library.

```
#include "noise.hpp"

int main() {
    ...
    SimplexNoise noise;

    for (auto y = 0; y < height; y++) {
      for (auto x = 0; x < width; x++) {
        double v = noise.simplexNoise(SimplexNoise::NoiseTypeEnum::PERLINNOISE,
                                      width,
                                      7,     // octaves
                                      0.45,  // persistence
                                      0.6,   // percentage
                                      14,    // scale
                                      x,
                                      y,
                                      z);    // time

        pixels[index++] = v * 255  // R
        pixels[index++] = v * 255  // G
        pixels[index++] = v * 255  // B
        pixels[index++] =     255; // A
      }
    }
    ...
}
```

In case of the example image, blending two colors rgb(255, 255, 255) and sky
blue rgb(42, 77, 130).

```
pixels[index++] = v * 255 + ((1.0 - v) * 42);   // R
pixels[index++] = v * 255 + ((1.0 - v) * 77);   // G
pixels[index++] = v * 255 + ((1.0 - v) * 130);  // B
pixels[index++] =     255;                      // A
```

### BACKGROUND INFO

My guess is that Christian added the fractal and turbulence modes on top of the
original Java version. I just made slight modifications to the code and
currently use the z-axis for time, in order to animate the noise.

### KNOWN ISSUES

- The original Java implementation has a 3D noise version, which is not ported.
- There are multiple ways to animate the perlin noise, there may be different
  and alternative ways to animate the noise that are worth investigating.
- No effort has been made to optimize the code further for C++ for now.
